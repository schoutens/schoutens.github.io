        Let I be a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring over a field. The        question of understanding linear syzygies of I has been of great        interest in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. When I is a        monomial ideal, the problem often leads to fascinating combinatorial        connections.

In honor of this theorem, the minimum number b such that the    invariant ring of a group G acting on a vector space V is generated by    polynomials of degree at most b, is now known as the noether number of the    representation, and written b(G,V).&nbsp; Over the last century, noether    numbers have been studied extensively. In 2002, Harm Derksen and Gregor    Kemper introduced the notion of a separating algebra: a subring of the    invariant ring with the same ability to separate the group orbits in the    underlying representation space. The analogous number for separating    algebras, b_{sep}(G,V), has drawn research attention, as it can be lower    than the noether number. <br>    <br>    In this talk, we examine the analogous number b_{field}(G,V) for fields of    rational invariants of finite abelian groups G in characteristic zero. This    program is motivated by signal-processing applications. Nonetheless, it is    much less studied than its invariant-ring and separating-algebra cousins.    The numbers b_{field}(G,V) can be much lower even than b_{sep}(G,V). Our    study reveals that they also behave differently than both b and b_{sep}, in    interesting ways. For example, with respect to b and b_{sep}, the regular    representation V_{reg} is the “worst-case scenario”: b(G,V) &#8804; b(G,V_{reg})    and b_{sep}(G,V) &#8804; b_{sep}(G,V_{reg}), for all representations V. In    contrast, for b_{field}, the regular representation is essentially the “best    case scenario”: b_{field}(G,V_{reg}) = 3, for any finite abelian group of    order &#8805;3. <br>    <br>    Another interesting difference in behavior is that for b and b_{reg}, there    is not much to say in the simplest case that G is cyclic of prime order p:    in this case, b(G,V) = b_{sep}(G,V) = p, for any nontrivial representation    V. In contrast, b_{field}(G,V) varies dramatically with the representation    V. In this talk, we focus mainly on this case, giving various new bounds on    b_{field}(G,V).<br>    <br>    This is joint work with Yeshua Flores, Thays Garcia, Rawin Hidalgo, and    Consuelo Rodriguez.    <p></p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p></p>    <hr>    <h1>Fall 2021</h1>    <br>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <h4><b class="alert">Friday, Oct 15, 4:00PM</b><br>      <b>Speaker</b>: Mads Villadsen (Stonybrook) <br>      <b>Title</b>: <i style="caret-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none;">Kodaira

More specifically, we find an exact      correspondence between ad-hoc collections of open subsets of Zar(K/k)      ordered by quasi-refinements and the category of normal models of K/k with      morphisms the birational maps. We then introduce suitable Grothendieck      topologies and we develop a sheaf theory on Zar(K/k) which induces locally      the sheaf theory of each normal model at once. Conversely, given a sheaf      on a normal model we extend it to a sheaf on Zar(K/k) and we prove that      both of these operations are compatible with respect to pushforwards and      pullbacks. As a result, we study the cohomology theory of the      Zariski-Riemann space and we show that on each local model it yields the      usual sheaf cohomology. If time allows, we will also show how to treat      ideal-sheaves on Zar(K/k) and blow-ups using our framework.</p>    <hr>    <h4><b>Friday, Nov 12, 4:00PM</b><br>      <b>Speaker</b>: Tai Ha (Tulane University)<br>      <b>Title</b>: Saturation bounds for smooth varieties (click here for a <a        href="https://youtu.be/eT7wt45zuD4">recording</a>      of the talk)</h4>    <h4><br>      Abstract: <b>Let X be a smooth variety which is ideal-theoretically        defined by an ideal J.

By      work of Hochster-Roberts, Boutot, Smith, Hochster-Huneke, Schoutens, and      Heitmann-Ma, we know that every pure subring of S is pseudo-rational,      hence Cohen-Macaulay. This applies in particular to rings of invariants of      linearly reductive groups. For pure maps R -&gt; S of rings essentially of      finite type over fields of characteristic zero, Boutot's result is even      stronger: if S is pseudo-rational, then R is pseudo-rational. We show that      Boutot's theorem holds more generally if R and S are quasi-excellent      Q-algebras, which we use to give new proofs of the theorems of      Hochster-Huneke and Schoutens. This solves a conjecture of Boutot and      answers a question of Schoutens in the quasi-excellent case.

Consequently, there is a morphism from an open      subset of the base of the family to the moduli stack of stable curves of      genus g with n marked points. Morally, projection onto the domain factor      from the closure of the graph of this morphism yields an alteration of the      base over which our old family extends to a family of stable curves. Now,      the old family whose fibers could have terrible singularities has been      improved to a new family whose fibers have at-worst nodal singularities.      There is a little issue, however: there is not necessarily a morphism from      the new family onto the old family, only a not-everywhere-defined      birational map! <br>      <br>      To show that this birational map from the new to the old family is indeed      a morphism, we study the projection onto the domain factor from the      closure of the graph of the map. We may arrange that the new family is      normal, and so the projection is a birational morphism onto a normal      variety. If we can show that this morphism is finite, i.e. has finite      fibers, Zariski’s Main Theorem will guarantee that the morphism is an      isomorphism, and so we will have a morphism from the new family to the old      family after all.

Efforts have been made since then to simplify the      proof and see if it can be made to work for positive characteristic, but      to no avail. <br>      <br>      Regardless of characteristic: <br>      The singularities of a curve are resolved in one fell swoop by the      normalization, a powerful tool hailing from algebra made to work for us in      geometry, by Jean-Pierre Serre’s Criterion for Normality, and we owe much      to Oscar Zariski for teaching us about the normalization.&nbsp; Joseph      Lipman dealt with surfaces in as much generality as one could hope      for.&nbsp; Threefolds are rumored to have been handled by Vincent Cossart      and Olivier Piltant, although their proof is quite long. Fourfolds and up      are uncharted territory for the most part.</p>    <p>In his 1996 paper Smoothness, Semi-Stability, and Alterations, Johan de      Jong introduces a paradigm shift for solving the problem of resolution of      singularities by relaxing a resolution of singularities to what he calls      an alteration. The distinction is that a resolution is a birational      morphism (generically one-to-one), whereas an alteration is a generically      finite morphism (generically finite-to-one). Every variety can be altered      to a nonsingular variety regardless of the characteristic. In fact, de      Jong’s technique paired up with Dan Abramovich’s geometric insight yields      a proof that every variety over a field of characteristic zero admits a      resolution of its singularities in a paper consisting of only twelve      pages, see Smoothness, Semi-Stability, and Toroidal Geometry. de Jong’s      technique relies on (at least) two ingenious ideas: <br>      The first is the statement that there is a simple blowup of any variety      that admits a morphism to a projective space of one less dimension whose      fibers are curves ~ intuitively, any variety can be modified to be a      family of curves. Taking the intermediate variety in what is known as the      Stein factorization of the morphism instead of the target projective space      ensures the curves in the family are connected.<br>      The second is that the curves in the family of curves that results can be      marked so as to become stable (in the sense of Pierre Deligne and David      Mumford) so that it gives rise to morphism into the moduli space of stable      curves, where we may take advantage of established facts about the moduli      space of stable curves, including the fact that its compactification has      curves with at worst nodal singularities.<br>      My talk has the goal of introducing Johan de Jong’s paradigm shift, and      indicating, to the extent that I can, the idea of the proof that every      variety may be altered to a nonsingular variety. An emphasis will be      placed on the picture that demonstrates that there is a simple blowup of      any variety that admits a morphism to a projective space of one less      dimension whose fibers are curves.</p>    <h4><br>      <em></em></h4>    <h4><em>€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£</em></h4>    <p><b>Friday, Oct 16</b><br>    </p>    <h4><b>Speaker</b>: James Myer (GC)<br>      <b>Title</b>: The alterations paradigm shift for the problem of resolution      of singularities (part 2) <b>(click here for a <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_woZ9Cv0zf84&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=pRW6ZPn_LDv0DnDIAK65Ad0CA4hBS-2mAmNa2_oHfF0&amp;r=su9rbAaoPddUII3VNWCTsAmhscBB0mu2imolGZ2kvVY&amp;m=VJAUFZsCp21WFutjwlRopJuD0s7fYqS3o4r18AobPGA&amp;s=fPc3E3sd3ae1MEV3Ze7uWLSthsch2Um4f825utDfiPA&amp;e=">recording</a>        of the talk)</b></h4>    <p><b>Abstract</b>:See above. </p>    <p></p>    <p><em><br>      </em></p>    <p><em>€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£</em></p>    <p><b>Friday, Oct 30</b><br>      <b>Speaker</b>: <strong>Miodrag Iovanov (Univ. of Iowa)</strong><br>      <b>Title</b>: Diamond Rings - a class of rings close to Noetherian (click      here for a <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_KcVKnzbEXVg&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=pRW6ZPn_LDv0DnDIAK65Ad0CA4hBS-2mAmNa2_oHfF0&amp;r=su9rbAaoPddUII3VNWCTsAmhscBB0mu2imolGZ2kvVY&amp;m=VJAUFZsCp21WFutjwlRopJuD0s7fYqS3o4r18AobPGA&amp;s=uXcs-jt39pLvqC2LHSv5568fZ9eAd6vg8IfZxR4SGkI&amp;e=">recording</a>      of the talk)<br>      <br>      Abstract. A ring is said to have property D(=diamond) if the injective      hull E of any simple module is locally Artinian, that is, a finitely      generated submodule of such an E is Artinian. Commutative Noetherian rings      are known to have property D. This property is of interest in      noncommutative rings, as Noetherian rings don't always have it, and it is      closely related to outstanding questions in algebra such as Jacobson's      conjecture (which states that the intersections of the powers of the      Jacobson radical of a noncommutative Noetherian ring is zero).<br>      <br>      Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, this has not been studied much for the      commutative case. We present several motivating examples and questions      from the non-commutative case, and then describe such recent results for      the commutative case. It turns out rings with this property D are exactly      rings which have "enough" modules of finite length. This simple      observation leads to generalizations of several classical results of      commutative Noetherian algebra - such that the Krull intersection theorem      - to the generality of rings with property D, and which recover also      results of Jans, Matlis, Vamos. On the other hand, we show that for      complete rings (with a suitable natural topology consisting of ideals of      co-finite length), property D is equivalent to the ring being Noetherian,      which further points to property D being quite "close" to Noetherian.<br>    </p>    <h4><em>€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£€¥$£</em></h4>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Friday, Nov 13</b><br>      <b>Speaker</b>: Xiaolei Zhao (University of California, Santa Barbara)<br>      <b>Title</b>: Title: Elliptic quintics on cubic fourfolds, O'Grady 10, and      Lagrangian fiberations (click here for a <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_c120wwz-2DW7M&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=pRW6ZPn_LDv0DnDIAK65Ad0CA4hBS-2mAmNa2_oHfF0&amp;r=su9rbAaoPddUII3VNWCTsAmhscBB0mu2imolGZ2kvVY&amp;m=VJAUFZsCp21WFutjwlRopJuD0s7fYqS3o4r18AobPGA&amp;s=HNr_cwmKnBFYOkQkqhKloywpX_CietFm85pTEaD5Whs&amp;e=">recording</a>      of the talk).<br>      <br>      <br>      Abstract: We will show how to construct hyperkähler manifolds of O'Grady      10 type out of smooth cubic fourfolds.

A choice of monomial order on S specifies an      initial ideal in(I) for I. The ring S/in(I) is the special fiber in a flat      family whose generic fiber is S/I, and it has long been understood that      S/I is “at least as good" as S/in(I) according to various notions of “good      behavior" for rings. For example, the depth of S/I is at least the depth      of S/in(I); thus S/I is Cohen-Macaulay if S/in(I) is Cohen-Macaulay.      Because of this principle, S/in(I) is called a “Gröbner degeneration” of      S/I. In full generality, the converse of this principle is false, as      implied by the term “degeneration” — good behavior of S/I need not pass to      S/in(I). However, in 1987, Bayer and Stillman showed that in an important      special situation, namely when I is in “generic coordinates,” the      relationship between S/I and S/in(I) is quite tight. In 2018, Aldo Conca      and Matteo Varbaro announced a theorem that if the monomial ideal in(I)      happens to be generated by squarefree monomials, then the relationship is      tighter still. The result established and sharpened a conjecture of      Herzog, and allowed the authors, as a corollary, to resolve a      long-standing mystery in the theory of algebras with straightening law      (ASLs).

Equipping C and (L,V)      with compatible real structures, it is more interesting to ask about the      total real inflection of (L,V). The topology of the real inflectionary      locus depends in a nontrivial way on the topology of the real locus of C.      We study this dependency when C is hyperelliptic and (L,V) is a complete      series. We first use a nonarchimedean degeneration to relate the (real)      inflection of complete series to the (real) inflection of incomplete      series on elliptic curves; we then analyze the real loci of Wronskians      along an elliptic curve, and formulate some conjectural quantitative      estimates.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><b>Friday, November 2</b><br>      <b>Speaker</b>: Ben Blum-Smith (Eugene Lang College / The New School)<br>      <b>Title</b>: Cohen-Macaulayness of invariant rings is determined by      inertia groups </p>    <p>Abstract: If a finite group G acts on a Cohen-Macaulay ring A, and the      order of G is a unit in A, then the invariant ring A^G is Cohen-Macaulay      as well, by the Hochster-Eagon theorem. On the other hand, if the order of      G is not a unit in A, then the Cohen-Macaulayness of A^G is a delicate      question that has attracted research attention over the last several      decades, with answers in several special cases but little general theory.      In this talk we show that the statement that A^G is Cohen-Macaulay is      equivalent to a statement quantified over the inertia groups for the      action of G on A, acting on strict henselizations of appropriate      localizations of A. In a case of long-standing interest — a permutation      group acting on a polynomial ring — we show how this can be applied to      find an obstruction to Cohen-Macaulayness that allows us to completely      characterize the permutation groups whose invariant ring is Cohen-Macaulay      regardless of the ground field.

Inspired by ideas from deformation theory, M. Artin found      that we may remove projectivity if we expand the category of schemes to      the new category of algebraic spaces. Roughly speaking, a quasi-separted      algebraic space is a sheaf in the etale topology which contains a dense      open scheme. The density assumption and the fact that the etale topology      is invariant under infinitesimal thickenings makes it possible to extend      geometric properties of schemes to these functors. Although these functors      are not geometric spaces, they behave well enough to allow for an      extension of most major results from scheme theory to algebra spaces      (e.g., Stein factorization, Chow's lemma, Finiteness of Cohomology, GAGA).      Furthermore, every algebraic space may also be viewed as a quotient of a      scheme modulo an etale equivalence relation, which immediately leads to      numerous examples. This material also serves as motivation to the larger      theory of algebraic stacks.
